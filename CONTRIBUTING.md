# contributing rules
In general, anyone can contribute if he / she asks kindly and follows the guidelines.
The language for commit messages, comments etc. is german, but if your german is not that good, you can choose english, but then you may not understand everything, that we commit.
## New Features
Please make for every new and/or untested feature a new branch and merge it only to master, when it is fully tested.
When the new feature requires deleting things, please ask for permission before merging it to master.
