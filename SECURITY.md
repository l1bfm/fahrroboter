## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report any security Vulnerability to the issues just like normal bugs.
I now, that this is not so quite safe, but because this program will never be used in critical infrastructure (at least I think so) that's not that important.

## When to expect security updates

Because I don't think, that there will be so many vulnerabilities in this simple piece of code, I will release security updates just when a vulnerability was found.
